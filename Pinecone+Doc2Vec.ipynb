However, specific pathways and metabolites for the disease are yet to be investigated. Here, twenty-eight metabolites, including fifteen major sweat constituents and thirteen compounds emitted from malodor-producing skin bacteria, were subjected to the metabometric analysis using Metaboanalyst. Different pathways in the butanoate metabolism revealed that acetolactate synthase (ALS) in skin Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) bacteria are catalyzing pyruvate to several malodor compounds like diacetyl. In the docking studies of the sulfonylurea-ALS interaction, five selected sulfonylureas, which originally were developed for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, showed different binding free energies (ΔG) from chlorimuron ethyl-a well-known ALS sulfonylurea inhibitor. Amongst five sulfonylureas, gliquidone and glisoxepide were found to have free energy differences that were lower than or equal to chlorimuron ethyl, revealing their high affinities to ALS. In the future, further investigations of gliquidone and glisoxepide against ALS in skin bacteria would be crucial in repurposing these two sulfonylureas as new anti-bromhidrosis drugs.\",\n",

Gut dysbiosis can result in chronic excess alcohol production that contributes to the development of hepatic steatosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether linolenic acid can manipulate the production of harmful alcohol and beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the metabolome of commensal Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and the virulent K. pneumoniae K1 serotype. Glucose fermentation by the K. pneumoniae K1 serotype yielded increased production of alcohol and decreased SCFAs (especially acetate and propionate) compared to those of commensal K. pneumoniae. However, the use of linolenic acid instead of glucose significantly reduced alcohol and increased SCFAs in the fermentation media of the K. pneumoniae K1 serotype. The work highlights the value of shaping the microbial metabolome using linolenic acid, which can potentially regulate the gut–liver axis for the prevention and treatment of alcohol-induced liver diseases.\",\n",
